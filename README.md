# HackerRank
This repo contains solutions to problems posted on HackerRank. Solutions are (generally) in Python 3 but may also be in Java or C++. The directory structure of the project is intended to mirror the same structure that HackerRank uses for their own site.

Notes:

Top-level directories contain a .gitkeep file so that they could be added to Git and tracked when they were initially created as empty directories.

Folders use SNAKE_CASE notation as a personal convention. It reads well but can still be imported if needed.

The _solution.py file is intended to be used as an initial template for any new solution.
